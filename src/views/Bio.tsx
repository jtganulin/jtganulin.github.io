                <p>
                    I am a self-motivated, thorough, and creative problem solver looking to bring value to companies and society through passionate web and software development that&apos;s backed by a desire for continuous learning, growth, and optimization.
                    <br /><br />
                    A strong team player, as well as an effective leader and independent contributor, I&apos;ve worked in a variety of roles across all phases of the software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and analysis to design, development, testing, and deployment, all the while employing my attention to detail and ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to deliver high-quality solutions wherever I am needed. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Outside of academic and employment pursuits, I&apos;m also a food enthusiast, amateur chef and baker, and photographer. I love reading, hiking, amd video games.
